# MyReads Project
Myreads is a book tracking app that allows the user to select and categorize books they have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project was built using React and pulled data from a provided API.

## Installation
Follow the steps below to load the project on your computer.
- Youâ€™ll need to have Node >= 6 on your local development machine. If you do not already have it, you can install using a package manager such as npm or nvm.
- Install the react package globally by typing the following command into your terminal `npm install -g create-react-app`
- You can now either clone this repo or download the files as a zip.
- Change into the new directory and run `npm install` from the command line
- After all of the packages are installed, run `npm start`. Your default browser should open with the app running at localhost.

## Functionality
The main page of the app displays a list of shelves that contain the provided books. The three shelves are:

- Currently Reading
- Want to Read
- Read

You are able to move each book to a new shelf by using the input selector. You can also choose to have the book display on none of the shelves. You can also search the book API for additional books to add from the search page.
